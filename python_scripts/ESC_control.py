!!!Need to download pigpio for the pwm control of GPIO prior to code execute!!!

Email code to self for Rpi operation
"""

# Simple code for the Raspberry Pi that should move a Robot Forward and Back then left and right.
# Need to get pigpio for the pwm
# Modules to import are Rpi.gpio for GPIO pin position data and time for timing.

# a lot of code examples use this, import RPi.GPIO as GPIO, instead of pigpio just as a note!!

from time import sleep   #importing sleep from time library to call directly
import os                #importing the os so as to communicate with the system
os.system ("sudo pigiod")  #launching the GPIO library
sleep(1) # Gives time for the system to process
